	<img class="profilepic" src="assets/images/portfolio picture.jpg" height="300" width="280">

	<p> I enjoy  web-development as if I it’s one of my loved hobbies. Every single time I become part of a project I am willing to spend as many hour necessary to complete it and make it the best possible. I have fun interacting with teams and sharing ideas, Team interaction opens up your mind and makes you think outsite de box. Currently I am attending school at Denver University completing a bootcamp in coding. My Goal is to change carriers and join either a big company or a start-up company, I believe either one will provide extensive experience and help me continue to learn and become better every day. I live to be challenge and enjoy learning new things every change I get making the best out of it. 
	I am open to the idea of working in all sorts of projects. My perspective of knowledge is that it comes from learning out of everyday's practice no matter how small or big the task. A lot of people stick to only learning from big challenges but just like in personal life, little things are what matter. Success comes when you tell yourself never to give up, and when you focus on your goals so strong that there is no obstacle big or small enough to stop you from reaching you goal.
